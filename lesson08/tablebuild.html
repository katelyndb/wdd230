    <!--  Create a "lesson-8" folder.

► Create an HTML file named "tablebuild.html" in the lesson folder.

► Create a new, supporting css file for this table activity and place it into an appropriate folder. 
        This css file will just be for the tablebuild.html file.

► Use the thead, tbody, and tfoot tags in your table structure.

► Use appropriate scope attributes in the table. Review the application of scope in a more complex example. (Links to an external site.)

► The font-family is Ubuntu, sans-serif.

► The color scheme is your choice. You must include zebra striping at some level.

► Use at least one instance of the first-child or nth:child() pseudo classes.

► Make sure the table is responsive in a smaller, phone view.

► Ensure that your HTML and CSS documents are valid.

► Get as close as possible to the displayed design and structure for full credit.-->
